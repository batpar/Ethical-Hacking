# Ethical-Hacking
My Journey into Ethical Hacking with Python.

1. portscanner - This allows a user to specify the host and ports they would like to scan. Uses threading for scanning multiple ports at once and
 optparse to provide the options to the code.

2. SSH - The sshbruteforce.py code allows you to login with bruteforce using a dictionary attack. This attack was carried out successfully on metasploitable.
The sshlogin.py using pexpect to automate the ssh login(useful for sysadmins.)

3. PasswordCracking - The hash.py file helps convert any arbitrary string value to a hash value of md5, sha1, sha256 and sha512.
